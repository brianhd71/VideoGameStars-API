# VideoGameStars-API
Online Video Game Stars API
This started out as a test project for a company I applied for. The spec was to make a component of online-users using a mock api 
and displaying a list of users. Since then, it's evolved into an API of video game icons like Mario (which probably dates me a bit)
This codeset includes a lightweight Vuejs frontend that can be accessed with the url:http://localhost:3001/ or it can be used as 
the back end for VideoGameStars-UI.
